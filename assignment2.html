		<p> What's more fun than a barrel of monkeys? A parameterized, interconnected, laser-cut, press fit construction kit of monkeys!</p>
		<p> Here's the  <a href= "https://github.com/gabiduncombe/gabiduncombe.github.io/blob/master/project_source_files/assignment1/monkey_v3.ai" >source file</a>. </p>
		<p> I started with the Illustrator file I created in Assignment 1 - the outline of the monkey without any of the notches cut into the hands and feet. I opened that Illustrator file directly in Rhino - and the outline appeared withiout me having to do any conversions. </p>
		<p> I started by scaling up the monkey outline to around 100mm tall - I didn't want the pieces to end up too tiny. Then, I needed to parameterize the notches in the hands and feet using Grasshopper. </p>

		<p> Finally, I had my monkeys - and they fit together perfectly! </p>
