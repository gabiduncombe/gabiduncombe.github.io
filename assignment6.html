          <h1>Assignment 6: Night King Ice Cube      </h1>
          <p></a><img src="imgs/Assignment6/square2.jpg" width="300" alt=""/></p>
          <p>Obviously, I was psyched to watch the Game of Thrones series finale this weekend, so I thought it would be fun to create a themed project: a Night King ice cube mold (winter is coming!). <a href="assignment4.html"></a></p>
		<p>Here's the <a href= "https://cad.onshape.com/documents/16e3c2f89867923143ba6789/w/21ce50573a184ab985e96af5/e/257e5ea718340eec91025043">link to the Onshape file</a> and the other source files. </p>
		<p>I purchased the food-safe Smooth-Sil 940 to make the ice mold, but first I had to start with the mold for the mold. I decided to 3D print it. </p>
	
		<p>I downloaded a <a href= "https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2562169"> Night King Bust from Thingaverse</a>, which provided a great mesh to start with. </p>
	
		<p>I brought the 3D file into Rhino, where I started designing the mold. </p>
		<p>I decided that due to the horns on top of his head, I had the best chance of getting the ice cubes out intact by splitting the mold along the middle of his face. Not ideal from an aesthetic perspective, but I think any other configuration would have had issues with the draft angle on the horns. The horns proved to be a bit tricky, regardless, but I think this was the optimal solution. </p>
		<p>I sliced the 3D mesh along the middle to create one half of the Night King's face. </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/Rhino.PNG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>I started designing the box around it but I decided to switch to Onshape where I could quickly dimension all the different attributes. </p>
		<p>I exported the half-face from Rhino as a .STL and imported it into Onshape, where I created all the rest of the components around it. The box creation was pretty easy, though it did take a while to wrap my brain around what needed to be created... it was hard thinking about the inverse of an inverse. </p>

		<p>It was ready to 3D print!</p>
		<p>But there was a small problem. For some reason that I still don't totally understand, Cura was not reading the mesh correctly and was creating a small gap. I was worried that the Smooth-Sil 940 would get into the gap and mess up the mold.</p>

		<p>I'm tried running the mesh through a repair tool I downloaded called Slic3r, where it found a bunch of errors. This alleviated the problem slightly but didn't solve it completely. </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/Repair.PNG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>But I decided to give it a shot, since it seemed like the gap would be quite small. </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/CuraSettings.PNG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Five hours later, I had a mold! I printed a second one for good measure, and in case anything went wrong. </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/3Dprint.JPG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Then it was time to pour the silicone! This mixture called for a ratio of 10:1. I ended up using 100g:10g for each of the molds.</p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/JJUW9676.GIF" width="350" alt=""/></p>
		<p>This part of the process was strangely satisfying.</p>
		<p>Then, I waited 24 hours for the silicone to cure!		</p>
		<p>I used a butter knife to pry it out but was it was getting stuck around the horns, so I had to rip apart the 3D-printed molds to slide the silicone mold out. I kind of anticipated that this would happen so it didn't feel too alarming. </p>
		<p>And the small gap I was worried about didn't seem to cause any issues. </p>

		<p>Molds fit together great! They look pretty fleshy and disturbing though. </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/IMG_3366.JPG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>The aftermath: </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/IMG_3367.JPG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Then it was time to cast some ice cubes!</p>
		<p>While the mold was pretty tight, I wanted to make sure water didn't leak out, so I used rubber bands to get them extra snug.</p>
		<p>I filled with water and put in the freezer, along with a bit of water in a cup that I was using to test when the water had turned to ice (since I didn't want to mess up the ice cubes by taking them out too early). </p>

		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/freezer2.PNG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>They came out great! </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/IMG_3488.JPG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>I ran a few more over the next few hours. </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment6/IMG_E3436.JPG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Plus I got out some GoT White Walker-themed Johnny Walker whisky to enjoy with the ice cubes :) </p>

		<p>What a great way to end  Game of Thrones!</p>
