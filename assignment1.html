          <p>

            </p>
          <p> What's more fun than a barrel of monkeys? An interconnected, laser-cut, press fit construction kit of monkeys!</p>
		<p> I started by bringing in a .png file with the silhouette of a monkey in it to Illustrator.</p>
		<p><img src="monkey_silhouette.png" width=300></a></p>
		<p> I traced the outline of the image in Illustrator using ImageTrace and adjusted the outline slightly to increase the size of the hands and feet. I also created rectangles that were as wide as the width of the cardboard I would be using and overlaid them onto the outline of the monkey. I cut these notches out of the monkey and tested with a red line (with length = the width of the cardboard) to verify the sizing of everything. I realized some of the spots might be a bit too thin and unstable, so I enlarged the hands a bit to create more stability. </p>

		<p> I duplicated the image to create 12 of them, changed the stroke width to .001pt, and then I was ready to print! </p>
