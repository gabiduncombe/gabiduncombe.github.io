          <h1>Assignment 7: Final Project Proposal</h1>

          <p><strong>Concept / References: </strong></p>
          <p>For my final project, I want to create a poseable mannequin toy that could be used for stop-motion animation. <a href="assignment4.html"></a></p>
		<p>I was inspired by the work of Rob Ives and have decided to try to adapt his concept (without using any of his source files). Here's a <a href= "https://notes.robives.com/finished-first-prototype/">blog post</a> where he details some of his work that gave me the inspiration!</p>
		<p>Here are some of his iterations: </p>

		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment7/Reference4.jpg" width="600" alt=""/></p>
		<p>So I love the idea behind this! I'm modifying it slightly to use 3D-printed beads, but will continue to use stock wooden dowels. </p>
		<p>Here's my initial concept sketch + a bit of early math.</p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment7/IMG_3645.JPG" width="600" alt=""/></p>
		<p><strong>Breakdown of Tasks:</strong></p>
		<p><em>2D design</em>: I will use Illustrator to design the laser-cut body parts (I have found it to work better for complex organic shapes)</p>
		<p><em>3D CAD design + parameterization:</em> I will use Rhino and Grasshopper to parametrically model the ball joints, allowing me to easily adjust both the outer radius and the inner cylinder radius.</p>
		<p><em>3D printing:</em> I will 3D print the ball joints. </p>
		<p><em>Laser cutting: </em>I will laser cut the body parts out of 3mm plywood. </p>
		<p><em>Moving parts: </em>I will connect the body parts together using the ball joints I create.	These	joints should be stiff enough to hold in place but moveable enough to modify the pose of the mannequin.</p>
		<p><strong>Timeline</strong>:</p>
		<p>Due to some pre-existing work plans, I needed to get a bit of a head start on this assignment. </p>
		<p><em>Wednesday, 5/22</em> - Order dowels, plywood, wood glue, super glue, and clamps from Amazon Prime and Lowe's. &gt;&gt; DONE</p>
	<p><em>Friday, 5/24</em> - Design all body parts in Illustrator. Design 3D model and run test print to determine print time. &gt;&gt; DONE</p>
		<p><em>Saturday, 5/25</em> - Laser-cut body parts. &gt;&gt; DONE</p>
		<p><em>Sunday, 5/26</em> - Glue half of pieces together.  3D print the ball joints. &gt;&gt; DONE</p>
		<p><em>Monday, 5/27</em> - Glue other half of pieces together. Contingency: reprint ball joints if not right size. &gt;&gt; DONE</p>
		<p><em>Thursday, 5/30 </em>- Glue entire mannequin together</p>
		<p><em>Saturday, 6/1 </em>- Documentation</p>
		<p><em>Sunday, 6/2 through Wednesday, 6/5</em> - Contingency Days</p>
		<p><strong>Bill of Materials: </strong></p>
		<p>(200) 3mm wooden dowels (Amazon)<em> - sourced on 5/23</em></p>
		<p>(48) 3mm 12&quot;x12&quot; plywood sheets <em>- sourced on 5/23</em></p>
		<p>Wood glue (Lowe's) - <em>sourced on 5/23</em></p>
