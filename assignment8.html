          <p><strong>Concept / References: </strong></p>
          <p>For my final project, I want to create a poseable mannequin toy.</p>
		<p>I was inspired by the work of Rob Ives and have decided to try to adapt his concept (without using any of his source files). Here's a <a href= "https://notes.robives.com/finished-first-prototype/">blog post</a> where he details some of his work that gave me the inspiration!</p>
		<p>He has a few different iterations of the concept, so I combined a few elements from different versions and created my own version.</p>
	<p>Here's my initial concept sketch:</p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment7/IMG_3645.JPG" width="600" alt=""/></p>
		<p><strong>Process</strong></p>
		<p>I started by designing the body parts in Illustrator,	since	I found have found Illustrator to be the easiest place to create and edit more organic shapes and curves.</p>
		<p>I created all the different components that I would need to laser cut  (using some of Rob Ives' work for reference on the side) and aligned them all to fit on a 12&quot;x12&quot; plywood sheet (1/8&quot; thick). </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/Illustrator.PNG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>I used the Epilog laser cutter at the Mill to cut all the different components. </p>
		<p>I used the recommended settings for 1/8&quot; wood cutting:</p>
		<p>Speed = 10%, Power = 100%, Frequency = 50%. </p>
		<p>These settings were perfect!</p>
		<p>One thing I forgot to account for: the size of the holes of the grate in the laser cutting bed. I had some pieces fall right through so I had to cut a few different versions to make sure I had a complete set of parts. </p>
		<p>If you are going to make this model on your own, I recommend scaling it up and adjusting the ball joint outer diameter accordingly, or making sure you cut enough versions that you have a complete set of parts.</p>

		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/IMG_3570.JPG" width="700"  alt=""/></p>
		<p>Next, it was time to design and 3D print the ball joints!</p>
		<p>I designed them in Rhino using Grasshopper for parameterization, so that I would be able to easily adjust the inner cylinder diameter to fit together with the dowels - and easily adjust the outer sphere size to give the right amount of friction with the laser-cut parts.</p>

		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/Rhino.PNG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>After a bit of experimentation and test prints to figure out the best 3D printer settings, I used the following settings on the 3D printer. Note: 99% concentric infill </p>
		<p>The nice thing about these ball joints was they were so small they only took 10-15 mins each to print. The model requires 14 of them.</p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/CuraSettings.PNG" alt="" width="460" height="889"/></p>
	<p>I needed to get the actual ball joint dimensions correct, so I ran through a few versions of adjustments to get everything at the dimensions I wanted. </p>
	<p>Final dimensions:</p>
	<p>Inner cylinder radius = 1.75mm</p>
	<p>Outer sphere diameter = 8.35mm</p>
	<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/GBBZ5565.GIF" width="350" alt=""/></p>
	<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/IMG_3559.JPG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
	<p>Once I had all the dimensions worked out, I needed to 3D print 16 ball joints. I tried printing them all at once but got spaghetti, regardless of whether I used a skirt or a raft. I recommend printing them individually.</p>

	<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/spaghetti1.PNG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Once they were all 3D printed, I needed to start gluing pieces together. I started by gluing each body part together with wood glue(except for the top layers). I used clamps to make sure things were given the right amount of pressue as the glue dried. </p>
		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/IMG_3575.JPG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Then, I glued wooden dowels into all of the ball joints using super glue. </p>
		<p>Next, I started putting the ball joints into the sockets and gluing the top layer on to hold them in place. I used clamps again here to get the right amount of pressure while the glue dried.</p>

		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/IMG_3622.JPG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Then I laid out the skeleton.</p>

		<p><img src="imgs/Assignment8/skeleton.PNG" width="700" alt=""/></p>
		<p>Next, I started the process of cutting all the dowels to a size that allowed the joints to move freely in all directions. Once the dowels were cut, I glued them into their corresponding  slots with superglue.</p>
		<p>Slowly but surely, the man started coming together. </p>

		<p>And then he was all done! Ready to be posed!</p>

        <p><strong>Recommendations for Improvements:</strong></p>
        <p>I recommend sizing up the model to avoid losing pieces while laser cutting. I would also recommend scaling the torso piece vertically by around 20 - 30%, since it ended up a little short. </p>
