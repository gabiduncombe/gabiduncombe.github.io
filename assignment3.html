		<p> For this lamp project, I wanted to stick with organic forms. I was inspired by the shape of the lightbulb itself, which reminded me of the head of a squid. </p>
		<p> This was a complicated project. I began by sketching to come up with a concept that I was happy with. I decided that I wanted to create a ring around the base of the lightbulb that housed the 8 legs, and an additional ring where I could fit an array that gave the head more of a squid shape (with the flare out at the top).

		<p>Thanks to Emma Meersman and Elizabeth Quepons for some Grasshopper support, Leo for the great web documentation that gave me the inspiration to make my array in Grasshopper using Linear Array, and Kim Dzubinski for the moral support! </p>
